  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Snowball cookies are technically called Mexican wedding cakes or Russian teacakes, but my grandmother gave up on us calling them that years ago! With a rich, nutty flavor from finely chopped pecans, and a sweet, powdery coating from confectioners' sugar, these tiny, buttery treats are truly the most delicious melt-in-your-mouth morsels.</h3>
      
      <ul>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</ul>
      <ul>½ cup powdered sugar</ul>
      <ul>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</ul>
      <ul> 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</ul>
      <ul>1 cup very finely chopped pecans</ul>
      <ul>¼ teaspoon salt</ul>
      <ul>⅓ cup powdered sugar, or more as needed </ul>

  

  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <li>Step 1</li>
      <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
    <li>Step 2</li>
     <p>Beat butter, 1/2 cup powdered sugar, and vanilla with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Gradually mix in flour, pecans, and salt until completely incorporated. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.</p>
    <li>Step 3</li>
      <p>Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are light golden brown but tops are still pale, 12 to 15 minutes. (Try not to let cookies get too brown: it's better to undercook them than to overcook them.)</p> 
    <li>Step 4</li>
      <p>Remove cookies from the oven and let sit on the baking sheets briefly before removing to wire racks.</p>
    <li>Step 5</li>
      <p>Place 1/3 cup powdered sugar in a shallow bowl; roll hot cookies in sugar to coat, then return to the wire racks to cool. Once cooled, roll cookies in the powdered sugar once more.
